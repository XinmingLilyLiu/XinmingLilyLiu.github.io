excerpt: 'This paper is about applying Markowitz mean-variance optimization model to capture the volatility mispricings in options trading. It is a whole semester project for [ORIE 5370: Optimization Modeling in Finance](https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP19/class/ORIE/5370).'

Since there is no deterministic away to compute implied volatility of an underlying asset – a crucial factor in options pricing – options may trade at prices that may or may not be fair. In this project, we aim to identify these mispricings in the options market using Autoregressive Monte Carlo Simulation on underlying assets, and maximize our expected profit by trading options spreads and combinations. Different options strategies are treated as individual assets and the Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization model is utilized to optimize our portfolio. We aim to trade these options strategies three hours before their expiration on Friday of every week. In the second part of the project, instead of using an Autoregressive Monte Carlo Simulation method, we simulate stock returns using a Multivariate Normal Distribution via Cholesky Decomposition.
