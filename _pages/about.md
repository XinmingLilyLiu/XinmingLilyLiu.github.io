My name is Lily, a senior at Cornell University College of Engineering, double majoring in Honors Programs of Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE) and Computer Science (CS). I am currently serving as the President of INFORMS Cornell chapter, Professional Development Chair of Tau Beta Pi and member of Omega Rho. 

I am interested in applying game theory, probability and optimization to study how strategic interactions between individuals can impact organizations and society as a whole. I have research experience in human behavior modeling, bounded rationality, ride sharing and reinforcement learning. Please go to [research](https://xinminglilyliu.github.io/publications/) section to learn more about those cool projects!

I like to apply what I have learned in classroom to solve real-world problems and I interned at Blackston, Amazon Robotics and ODH, Inc. Teaching is another excellent way of learning. I have listed the courses that I serve as an undergraduate teaching assistant [here](https://xinminglilyliu.github.io/teaching/).

Outside of academia, I am an avid reader and please check out my [book rack](https://xinminglilyliu.github.io/portfolio/) for my favoriate books in decision making, game theory, behavioral economics and mathematical thinking.
