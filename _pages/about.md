I am Lily, a Senior at Cornell University College of Engineering. I double major in hornors programs of Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE) and Computer Science (CS) and minor in Mathematics. I am currently serving as the President of INFORMS (Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences) Cornell chapter, Professional Development Chair of Tau Beta Pi (National Engineering Honor Society) and member of Omega Rho (International Honor Society for Operations Research and Management Science). 

Research
------
I am interested in applying quantitative modelings and operations research to solve real-life problems, especially in game theory and decision under uncertainty. I am currently doing research with Professor Joe Halpern on bouned rationality and predictable irrationality, with the applications in ranger-poacher game and slot machine. 
I have worked on capturing volatility in options trading using Markowitz Optimization Model under Professor James Renegar and classifying audio events using optimized machine learning algorithm under Professor Christoph Studer.

Teaching
------
I have been a [CUES](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/engdiversity/current-students/undergraduates/academic-support/cues-tutoring) peer tutor for [CS 2800: Discrete Structures](https://courses.cs.cornell.edu/cs2800/wiki/index.php/CS_2800_Spring_2018) and an undergraduate TA for [CS 4852: Networks II: Market Design](https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/info4220/), [ORIE 3310: Optimization II](https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP19/class/ORIE/3310) and [ORIE 3510: Introduction to Engineering Stochastic Processes I](http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=31&coid=493409).

Working Experience
------
I interned at Blackstone Innovations during Summer 2019 as a technology analyst. From July 2018 to December 2018, I was at Amazon Robotics Operations Intelligence group as a Data Engineer Coop. I interned at ODH,Inc as a security analyst my freshman summer.

Principles
------
I enjoy reading The Principles by Ray Dalio. I follow three guiding priciples that define me much better than any noun.

**Life is a Marathon.**

Life is long and there is no need to hurry.
