Hello, World! My name is Lily, a senior at Cornell University College of Engineering, double majoring in Honors Programs of Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE) and Computer Science (CS). I am currently serving as the President of INFORMS Cornell chapter, Professional Development Chair of Tau Beta Pi and member of Omega Rho. 

I am interested in applying game theory, probability and optimization to study how strategic interactions between individuals can impact organizations and society as a whole. I am currently doing research with Professor Joe Halpern on bouned rationality and predictable irrationality, with the applications in ranger-poacher game and slot machine porblem. Other projects I am working on include ride sharing and reinforcement learning using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). I have worked on capturing volatility in options trading using Markowitz Optimization Model under Professor James Renegar and classifying audio events using optimized machine learning algorithm under Professor Christoph Studer. Please go to [research](https://xinminglilyliu.github.io/publications/) section to learn more about those cool projects!

I like to apply what I have learned in classroom to solve real-world problems and I interned at Blackston, Amazon Robotics and ODH, Inc. Teaching is another excellent way of learning. I have listed the courses that I serve as an undergraduate teaching assistant [here](https://xinminglilyliu.github.io/teaching/).

Outside of academia, I am an avid [reader](https://xinminglilyliu.github.io/portfolio/). I enjoy reading The Principles by Ray Dalio. I follow three guiding priciples that define me much better than any noun.

**You are what you decide to be.**
Life is full of choices and we make decisions that shape us into who we are. It is interesting to understand more about the decision-making mechanisms.
**Life is a Marathon.**
Life is long and there is no need to hurry.
**Your network is every single person you met in your life.**
