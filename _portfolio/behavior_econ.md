My favoraite book is "Predictably Irrational." As it mentioned in the book, our irrational behaviors (for example, people think expensive medicines are more efficient or we are bad at saving money) are neither random nor senseless -- they are systematic and predictable. Once we understand when and where we may make erroneous decisions, we can try to be more vigilant, force ourselves to think differently about these decisions, or use technology to overcome our inherent shortcomings. "Thinking fast and slow" and "Misbehaving" are also two interesting books to read about human behaviors.
