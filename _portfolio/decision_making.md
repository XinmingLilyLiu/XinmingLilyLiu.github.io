Life is full of choices and people make decisions every day. I am very interested in understanding the mechanisms behind decision-making process. The book "Smart Choices" suggests a general guideline for making well-informed decisions: thinking about the objectives, consequences and alternatives. As pointed out in the book, an effective decision-making process should focus on what's important, be logical and consistent, acknoledge both subjective and objective factors and blend analytical with intuitive thinking. It is my favorite book in the study of decision-making. In the book "Reasoning about Uncertainty," Professor Halpern discusses different ways to represent uncertainty, update beliefs and use formal logic for reasoning. "The Art of Thinking Clearly" points out some of the most common thinking errors, from cognitive biases to elements like envy and social distortions.
